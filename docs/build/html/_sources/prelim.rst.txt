| Heat a small portion of | - Sample completely     | - May be methanol or |
| the sample in a test    |   evaporates leaving no |   ethanol or acetone |
| tube                    |   residue.              |                      |
|                         | - A syrapy residue      | - May be glycerol    |
|                         |   appears at            |                      |

|                         |   evaporates with a     |                      |
|                         |   white dense fumes.    |                      |

| Treat a small portion   | - Charring takes place  | - May be acetone     |
| of the sample with      | - No appreciable change | - May be glycerol    |
| conc. sulfuric acid     |   with a slight yellow  |                      |
| and warm gently if      |   color                 |                      |
| necessary.              |                         |                      |
